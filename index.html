        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Home cooks are our heroesâ€”it's as simple as that. 
                Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: 
                The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon 
                but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The 
                bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as 
                happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. 
                The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons 
                of dirty dishes at the end of the night.</p>
